      <p>Equity  West Capital Partners seeks to invest in unique single and multi-family real estate opportunities primarily located on the 
West Coast.  </p><br />


<p><strong>SINGLE FAMILY STRATEGY</strong></p>

<p>EWCP has created a privately managed real estate equity fund, EWCP TS FUND I, LLC.  The fund will target the acquisition of foreclosed real estate 
assets.  The Fund will seek to purchase residential real property 
(predominantly single family homes) from trustee sale auctions located at various courthouses in Southern California.  Once purchased, these homes 
will be vacated, repaired and resold on the open retail market via MLS listings.  Houses will be purchased at deep discounts with a minimum net 
profit goal of 10% per property.  The Fund will aim to have average property turn times of 90 days or less.  The fund's core markets are the Counties of 
Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, and Los Angeles.  The market climate for this business strategy is excellent due to the high retail demand 
fueled by the current housing affordability levels and ease of homeowner financing. </p><br />


<p><strong>Acquisition Parameters</strong></p>
         
      <ul >
        
<li>Target auction purchase price of $50,000-$500,000 per property</li>
        
<li>Seek to limit property locales to high-demand market areas</li>
        
<li>Prospective properties wil be eligible for FHA financing</li>
        
<li>Set conservative ceiling on purchase price to value ratio</li>
<li>Strong preference toward vacant properties</li>
        
      </ul>
      

<p><strong>Buying Strategy</strong></p>
          
      <ul>
 

<li><b>Property Selection:</b> Utilizing Trustees’ websites to locate properties with minimum bids one week in advance; 24 hour updates and updates every 10 minutes the morning of the sale from our proprietary software which generates an equity potential based 
on the minimum bid vs our AVM values</li>

<li><b>Valuation:</b> Utilizing a combination of our subscription AVM (VeroValue); cyberhome.com and eppraisal.com to find prospective deals that have profit 
potential; performing BPOs on the shortened list of properties with Minimum Bids and profit potential using multiple active, pending, and recently closed 
comparables</li>

<li><b>Title Research:</b> Using County Records research to perform due diligence on title; investigating liens, encumbrances, city filings; utilizing TICOR 
Title for date downs on the title the morning of the sale to ensure title is still unclouded (dedicated title representative assigned to give 
live support to EWCP whenever needed)</li>

<li><b>Property Inspection:</b> Day prior to sale, send out a team member to inspect each property to check for possible tenants, property damage, potential 
issues; morning of sale inspect any additional properties that have experienced minimum bid drops; talking to neighbors and/or prior real estate agents 
that worked on the property to gain history/perspective; talk to tenants or owners if appropriate</li>

<li><b>Bidding Process:</b> Bidders will be sent to the court house with an appropriate sum of cashier’s checks 
and a list of properties to bid and maximum bid amounts; bidders will be in constant contact with their assigned analyst at the office who will 
be performing title date downs, minimum bid updates and final decision making for the purchase; bidders are required to sign a confidentiality 
agreement to protect the name and model EWCP is using</li></ul>
   
<p><strong>Asset Disposition</strong></p>
        
      <ul>
        
<li><b>Occupancy Solutions:</b> Utilize in-house negotiator to effect agreements to vacate with tenants where applicable and legal counsel to process evictions otherwise</li>
        
<li><b>Property Preservation & Enhancement:</b> Perform basic cosmetic, safety, and finace driven repairs to minimize marketing time and maximize sales price</li>
<li><b>Marketing:</b> Multi-pronged marketing approach through related brokerage entity to swiftly put property into escrow</li>
<li><b>Closing:</b> Dedicated transaction coordinator will cross-qualiy Buyers and track escrow process to ensure short and successful close</li>
      </ul>

<p><strong>MULTI FAMILY STRATEGY</strong></p><br />
<p>EWCP looks for off-market transactions that provide  potential to add value with a low tolerance for risk. Investments include direct 
equity capital  combined with a reasonable level of debt where possible or in structured joint  ventures with strategic partners. 
<br />
        <br /> 

      EWCP  tends to focus on rapidly growing infill locations that have limited land  supply, strong job retention/growth, gentrifying surroundings and
 a long term  potential upside in both rents and/or values.   EWCP tries to stay away from outlying areas and higher risk  acquisitions.  Demographic, 
economic, and  overall population mapping is used as a basis for all high level acquisition  discussions.  <br />
      <br />


EWCP  aims to increase 
investor returns through a detailed due diligence and  acquisition process.  This helps to  mitigate risk and increases portfolio stability. Our 
underwriting process  entails:</p><br />

returns</li>
